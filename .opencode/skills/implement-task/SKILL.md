# Implement Task

## Use this when

- The user or an issue defines a concrete implementation task.
- The expected output is code, config, docs, or release-support changes inside this repository.

## Workflow

1. Start from the concrete task or issue context.
   - If the request is still too ambiguous to implement safely, ask one targeted question.
2. Read `AGENTS.md` and only the files needed for the task.
3. Make the smallest coherent change that satisfies the request.
   - Avoid unrelated refactors
   - Preserve existing module boundaries and repo conventions
4. Run the most relevant validation when practical:
   - TypeScript changes -> `npm run typecheck`
   - Packaging or release changes -> the most relevant release command from `AGENTS.md`
   - If validation is not practical, say exactly what remains to verify
5. Once you reach a meaningful checkpoint, create a LOCAL commit without asking.
   - Use Conventional Commits
   - Choose an accurate type and scope
   - Commit only the files relevant to that checkpoint
6. Do NOT push. Work on local git only. Push happens after verification passes and user approves.
7. Report touched files, validation results, and clear retest guidance for `tester`.
   - Include how to run the feature
   - Include the main acceptance path or scenarios to verify
   - Include mock-mode, seed data, or setup details when relevant
8. State whether the implementation appears complete, but leave the final delivery gate to `tester` and `product-manager`.

## Guardrails

- Never push - push happens after verification passes and user approves.
- Never rewrite history or force-push unless the user explicitly asks.
- Work around unrelated local changes; do not revert them.
- If the task is mostly roadmap, issues, milestones, or release planning rather than implementation, hand it off to `product-manager`.

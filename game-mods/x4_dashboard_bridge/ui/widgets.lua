-- Application state is refreshed every 50ms.
-- Each widget is assigned to one or many of the groups limited by maxGroup value.
-- Group number means in what call it should be executed.
-- So eg. widget assigned to groups { 1, 2, 3 } will be executed every tick.
-- But widget assigned to group { 3 } will be executed only every third tick.

# X4 Dashboard

A playable real-time cockpit dashboard for X4: Foundations.

It combines a React + Arwes frontend, a small Node.js bridge server, and an X4 Lua mod that pushes game state straight into browsers on the same machine or other devices on your LAN. The project is already usable as a second-screen control panel and live status display, even though it is still evolving.

The bundled Lua mod is a modified version of the X4 External App mod by Mycu. `x4-dashboard` keeps the game-side data export idea, but replaces the original frontend with its own Node.js server and React dashboard.

## What it does

- Shows live ship, navigation, combat, mission, research, and logbook data.
- Streams updates from X4 over HTTP into a unified WebSocket game state.
- Lets you trigger selected ship actions from the dashboard through configurable key bindings.
- Includes a mock-data mode so you can preview the UI without running the game.

## Screens and features

- Ship hull and shield status.
- Navigation speed, boost energy, travel drive, and flight-assist indicators.
- System controls for Flight Assist, SETA, Travel Drive, and Autopilot.
- Target and combat telemetry.
- Mission offers and active mission details.
- Logbook, research, faction, inventory, and transaction widgets.
- Connection indicators for dashboard and game feed state.

## Important safety note

This app can simulate local key presses on the machine where the server is running.

- Keep it on a trusted local machine or private LAN only.
- Do not expose the server directly to the public internet.
- Control endpoints are localhost-only by default. Set `ALLOW_REMOTE_CONTROLS=true` only if you understand the risk.
- The game window usually needs to be focused, or running borderless windowed, for key presses to land reliably.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- X4: Foundations
- The `djfhe_http` X4 dependency required by `game-mods/mycu_external_app/content.xml`
- Optional: `VerboseTransactionLog` if you want richer transaction-log data

Platform notes for key simulation:

- Windows: AutoHotkey v2 is recommended for reliable in-game key presses; PowerShell `SendKeys` is used as a fallback when AutoHotkey is unavailable
- Linux: `xdotool`
- macOS: `osascript`

## Quick start

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm run install:all
```

Preview with mock data:

```bash
npm run mock
```

Then open `http://localhost:3001`.

## Running with the real game

This repository keeps source files only. The production frontend in `server/public/` is generated locally and ignored by Git.

Build the client before starting the server, and rebuild after frontend changes:

```bash
npm run build
```

Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:3001` in your browser.

## Server launcher

The Windows Electron build is now a server launcher, not a separate dashboard client. It starts the local server and shows the local/LAN URLs you can open from browsers.

Run the launcher in development:

```bash
npm run desktop:dev
```

Run the launcher against the locally built production frontend:

```bash
npm run build
npm run desktop:start
```

Build Windows desktop artifacts:

```bash
npm run desktop:dist
```

Generated launcher artifacts are written to `release/`.

Windows note:

- Install AutoHotkey v2 on the same machine as the dashboard server if you want dashboard buttons to work reliably in X4.
- The server will auto-detect common AutoHotkey install paths.
- If needed, set `AUTOHOTKEY_PATH` to the full `AutoHotkey64.exe` path.

## Development

Hot-reload frontend and backend together:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Vite frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Node server: `http://localhost:3001`

Validation:

```bash
npm run check
```

There is no dedicated test suite yet; TypeScript checking is the main validation step for the client.

Release validation:

```bash
npm run release:check
```

Build distributable server and Lua mod bundles:

```bash
npm run release:bundle
```

Artifacts are written to `dist/` and split into:

- a standalone server package for browser-based clients
- a standalone Lua mod package

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | `3001` | Server port |
| `MOCK` | unset | Forces mock mode when set to `true` |
| `AUTOHOTKEY_PATH` | unset | Explicit path to `AutoHotkey64.exe` |
| `X4_FORCE_ACTIVATE` | `false` | Try to focus the game window before sending keys |
| `X4_WINDOW_TITLE` | `X4` | Window title fragment used for focus matching |
| `ALLOW_REMOTE_CONTROLS` | `false` | Allows remote access to `/api/keypress` and keybinding management |

## X4 mod setup

The Lua integration source lives in `game-mods/mycu_external_app/`.

This Lua mod is a modified version of X4 External App. The original X4 External App Node application is not required for `x4-dashboard` to work, because this project ships its own Node.js app that replaces the original frontend/backend flow.

For releases, use the dedicated Lua mod zip and copy the included folder into your X4 extensions directory so the final path looks like this:

```text
X4 Foundations/extensions/x4_dashboard_bridge/
```

The mod posts data to the dashboard server on every tick. Configuration is in `ui/config.lua` inside the packaged extension folder:

```lua
host = '127.0.0.1'
port = 3001
```

If your dashboard server runs on another machine on your LAN, update `host` accordingly.

The packaged extension uses a dedicated X4 content id so it does not conflict with the original Mycu mod.

## Credits

Special thanks to Mycu, the author of X4 External App, for the original mod that made this integration path possible.

## Key bindings

Bindings are stored in `server/config/keybindings.json` and editable from the dashboard UI.

On Windows, these bindings are sent through AutoHotkey when it is available, which is more reliable for games than plain `SendKeys`.

Supported key format uses SendKeys-style notation:

| Format | Example | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Function keys | `{F1}` | Function key |
| Regular keys | `a` | Plain key |
| Ctrl | `^a` | Ctrl+A |
| Shift | `+a` | Shift+A |
| Alt | `%a` | Alt+A |
| Special keys | `{ENTER}` | Enter |
| Arrow keys | `{UP}` | Up arrow |

## Architecture overview

The app is a single Node.js server that serves a locally built React frontend from `server/public/`.

Data flow:

1. The X4 Lua mod posts widget payloads to `POST /api/data`.
2. `server/utils/normalizeData.js` strips X4 formatting codes.
3. `server/dataAggregator.js` merges partial updates into one durable game state.
4. The server broadcasts the state to browser clients over WebSocket.
5. Dashboard control buttons call `POST /api/keypress`, which forwards key presses to the host OS.

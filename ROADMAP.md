# Roadmap

This roadmap is a lightweight public planning document for a shorter, more frequent release cadence.

## Release plan

### v1.2.0 - Network and settings foundation
- Make LAN access a first-class runtime mode so the app is reachable from other devices without manual setup
- Add a dedicated settings and diagnostics surface for the current host/client model
- Move important runtime configuration into the app UI instead of relying only on environment variables
- Keep this release focused on the minimum foundation needed to make future setup and control work smoother

### v1.3.0 - Controls and onboarding
- Add in-app keybinding capture by listening for keyboard input
- Investigate automatic import of X4 key bindings from local game settings
- Write a non-technical installation and usage guide for new players
- Reduce friction between first launch, setup, and the first successful control action

### v1.4.0 - Widget reliability and data coverage
- Improve empty, loading, and disconnected states across widgets
- Expand typed support for remaining game data areas still treated loosely
- Add more widgets for factions, inventory, transaction log, and agents
- Verify UnderAttack widget data flow and close any remaining game-state coverage gaps

### v1.5.0 - Quality and release presentation
- Add an initial automated test suite to protect the most important flows
- Capture screenshots for under-attack and active-target states
- Improve release presentation with better screenshots and supporting docs where useful
- Keep CI and release packaging polished as the project becomes easier to distribute

## Already landed in the current release train

- Custom desktop app icons and installer branding
- Improved desktop first-run experience
- Split release artifacts into server, browser client, Electron launcher, and Lua mod packages
- Renamed and cleaned up shipped dashboard presets
- Refreshed `README.md` with better structure and screenshots
- Fixed scrolling in the Mission Offers and Comms widgets

## Next major version vision

### v2.0.0 - User-defined dashboards
- Move beyond editing `client/src/dashboards.ts` as the only way to define layouts
- Let users create, edit, duplicate, reorder, and delete dashboards from the app UI
- Persist dashboard definitions in user-managed storage instead of hardcoded source only
- Keep a built-in set of curated default dashboards while allowing custom user presets
- Design the widget/layout model so custom dashboards stay compatible with future widgets and data fields
- Let users manage which built-in dashboards are visible so shipped presets and custom presets can coexist cleanly

## How this is managed

- Each minor release gets its own GitHub milestone
- Implementation tasks are tracked as GitHub issues and reassigned as scope is split
- `v2.0.0` stays reserved for user-defined dashboards unless a larger strategic shift appears
- Scope may still move based on feedback from early public users, but each release should stay intentionally small
